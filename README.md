# Chat Demo with Socket IO

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, run:
### `npm install`

and then
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

###Notes:
The selection of 'No' in the Widget does not close the chat
because I understood that it broke the demo propose.

For time situations I was not able to do the bonus point.
